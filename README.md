# Dart Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction
This Dart console application is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It provides two modes: Player vs. Player (1v1) and Player vs. AI (1vAI), offering an engaging experience for players.

## Features
- **Game Modes**: 
  - Player vs. Player (1v1) for two players to compete.
  - Player vs. AI (1vAI) for a single-player mode against a basic AI opponent.
- **Marker Selection**: Players can choose their markers ('X' or 'O') at the start of the game.
- **Dynamic Board Updates**: The board updates after every move, showing the current state.
- **Win and Draw Detection**: The game checks for winning conditions or a draw after every turn.
- **AI Logic**: The AI automatically selects the first available empty square during its turn.

## How to Play
1. At the start, choose your preferred game mode (1v1 or 1vAI).
2. Select your marker ('X' or 'O') for the game.
3. For each turn:
   - Enter the number corresponding to the square where you want to place your marker.
   - The board updates to reflect your move.
4. The game ends when:
   - A player or the AI wins (a row, column, or diagonal is filled with the same marker).
   - All squares are filled without a winner (draw).
